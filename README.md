# grpc-api
Basic implementation of a gRPC API

This is a gRPC API with Typescript in a Node application by building a basic auth service.

The server will have a method called login used for logging in the user. It will result in the status and authorization token if successful.

The client will be able to call this function and get the response from the server.
